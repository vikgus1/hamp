Design doc:

A tool useful for small scale business, associations and home owners for translating long term planned maintenance into 
yearly saving targets.

**Input** 
Single .yaml file with all actions. An action should have the following quantities:
- Descriptive name (must be clear what you should order from builders etc).
- Quantity.
- Unit of qty.
- Cost (currency not important since you're likely only using the local currency).
- Frequency (years).
- Year of first action.
- Facility (garage, hallways, etc.)

**Output**
Multiple options. Including but not limited to:
- This year's saving target.
- Graph of maintenance fund over time, as money is added and actions consume funds.
- Curated list of actions, i.e. actions for a given year or for a given facility.
